# 🌐 Gianluca Langhans – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This site showcases who I am, my background, and the projects I've built as a passionate full-stack developer.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Gianluca Langhans, an 18-year-old student from Milan, Italy. I study at *Liceo Linguistico Schiaparelli Gramsci* and discovered my love for programming in 2022. Since then, I've been creating modern, visually appealing websites with a focus on clean design and responsive UI/UX.

In addition to development, I have a strong passion for languages. I speak:
- 🇮🇹 Italian (native)
- 🇬🇧 English (fluent)
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese (fluent)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (fluent)
- 🇫🇷 French (fluent)
- 🇩🇪 German (basic)

I'm aiming to pursue a degree in Software Engineering to continue growing in the field I love.
